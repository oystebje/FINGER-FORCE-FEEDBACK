# FINGER-FORCE-FEEDBACK

Repository for project on reality-based modelling of partial meniscectomy.

Repository contains code and CAD models for:
1) Prototype for collecting force-position data from Acufect Upbiter Punch, with ARDUINO MKR Zero based FSR-sensor and potentiometer.
2) Protype for rendering haptic feedback of partial meniscectomy using self-designed hardware, Arduino DUE with SimpleFOC shield, BLDC motor, and AMT 102V encoder.
